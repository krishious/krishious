 Hi, I’m @krishious
 I am 11 years old, and I am in 6th grade.
 I’m interested in coding Full-Stack development.
 I’m currently learning to code in Python, JavaScript, Java, and C#.
 I would like to learn UI design, (Photoshop and Illustrator) and get a 3D animation software (Blender and learn the library Three.JS).
 # Bye!
